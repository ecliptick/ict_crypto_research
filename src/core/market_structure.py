"""Market structure: swings, BOS/CHoCH, order blocks, liquidity sweeps.

Pure-function detector that mirrors the UAlgo "Price Action Toolkit Lite"
Pine indicator (the reference script in the user query) and exposes the
state needed to gate FVG / iFVG entries on confirmed structure breaks.

The Pine indicator's *trade-relevant* primitives are:

* **Swing high / swing low** — ``ta.highest(high, N)[N]`` style pivots,
  right-side confirmed after ``N`` bars.
* **Trend** — a state machine that flips on a confirmed swing in the
  opposite direction.
* **Break of Structure (BoS)** — the first close through the prior
  swing, **continuing** the existing trend. *Confirmation.*
* **Change of Character (CHoCH)** — the first close through the prior
  swing **against** the existing trend. *Warning / potential reversal.*
* **Order block** — the highest-high candle of the bearish leg (for a
  bear OB) or the lowest-low candle of the bullish leg (for a bull
  OB), with an ATR-sized box that lives until price violates it.
* **Liquidity sweep** — a confirmed pivot whose level is wicked through
  AND closed back through on the same bar (failed break / stop-hunt).

A **CHoCH+** is a CHoCH that was caused by a *real* displacement —
here defined as "the break leg contained an FVG" (so the FVG detector
can confirm the break was structural, not a fake stop-hunt). CHoCH+
is the high-conviction reversal; a bare CHoCH is a caution flag.

This module is pure NumPy / Python — no Numba, no I/O, no trading
math. SL/TP / position bookkeeping stays in
``src/backtest/trend_backtest.py`` and the live executors; this module
just emits *structure state* per bar so the strategy layer can use it
as a conviction filter.

    Mirrors the UAlgo Pine indicator:

    * Swing = a bar whose high is the max of ``high[i-pivot_len : i+pivot_len+1]``
      (right-side confirmed at ``i + pivot_len``). Same for lows.
    * Trend = a state machine: ``+1`` when last swing is high (or no
      swings yet and the most recent flip was up), ``-1`` when last
      swing is low. **NOT** the same as the Pine's `trend` variable,
      which tracks a *coarser* direction (a swing high in a bull trend
      means the trend is *still* bull; a swing low in a bear trend
      means the trend is *still* bear). The convention used here:
      trend flips when the *first* close-through of the prior swing
      in the opposite direction occurs.
    * Break = first close through the prior swing, edge-triggered
      (one event per swing level). Labelled BoS or CHoCH based on
      the prior trend.

    Parameters
    ----------
    high, low, close : np.ndarray
        OHLC arrays, any frequency (1s recommended).
    pivot_len : int
        Right-side confirmation length for *swings / BoS / CHoCH*.
        Default 9 matches the Pine default. With 1s data and
        ``resample_to_n_secs=0``, this is a 19-second pivot — which
        produces far too many micro-swings to be useful. Either
        set ``resample_to_n_secs=60`` (1m pivots) or use a much
        larger ``pivot_len`` (~3600 for 1h pivots on 1s data).
    liquidity_len : int
        Pivot length for *liquidity sweeps*. Default 30 matches
        the Pine default.
    detect_order_blocks : bool
        If True, draw OB boxes for every structure break.
    detect_liquidity : bool
        If True, detect liquidity sweeps.
    atr_length : int
        ATR length for OB box sizing. Default 14 (Pine default).
    resample_to_n_secs : int
        **2026-08-20: structure timeframe knob.** If > 0, the
        detector internally aggregates OHLC into N-second bars
        BEFORE scanning for swings / BoS / CHoCH, then expands the
        resulting per-bar arrays back to the original resolution.
        This is the canonical ICT convention — pivot_len is
        measured in *bars of the chart you're viewing*, not in
        the underlying tick stream. With ``pivot_len=9`` and
        ``resample_to_n_secs=60``, you get a 9-bar 1m pivot
        (≈ 9 min on each side), which is the right granularity
        for XAUUSD 1s data. The detector's output ``StructureState``
        is still indexed by the *original* bar positions (i.e.
        length == ``high.shape[0]``) so backtest callers don't
        have to change anything. The ``breaks`` list is also
        remapped back to original-resolution bar indices. Set to
        ``0`` (default) to use the raw input bars (legacy).

    Returns
    -------
    StructureState
        All per-bar arrays + raw event log.
