"""ICT and Wyckoff signal primitives.

Four pure-function detectors for instant / structural signals that
complement the slow GMMA trend indicator (see
``src/core/gmma_indicators.py``):

* **FVG** (Fair Value Gap) — 3-bar imbalance where the middle bar's
  high/low don't overlap with bars 1 and 3. Fires on the FIRST bar of
  a displacement, not 60 bars later (the GMMA's structural lag).
* **iFVG** (Inversion FVG) — a previously-respected FVG that has been
  *violated* by a full candle body close through it. The zone flips
  polarity; the first retest is the entry.
* **ORB** (Opening Range Breakout) — session-open range (London 07:00
  UTC, NY 13:30 UTC) — break above opens a long, break below opens a
  short. Highest-vol windows on XAUUSD.
* **Wyckoff phase tagger** — coarse regime classifier: accumulation /
  distribution / spring / UTAD. Used as a confidence multiplier.

All detectors are pure functions of OHLC + tz-naive int64 ns timestamps.
They emit boolean arrays and ``PendingSignal``-compatible intent
objects, so the strategy layer can mix and match them with the existing
GMMA signal pipeline.

**No Numba, no I/O, no trading math.** All SL/TP/bookkeeping lives in
``src/backtest/trend_backtest.py`` and the live executors — this module
just emits signal intents.

# Renko bricks (2026-09-05)
# ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# Renko bars are a time-independent price series. A new brick forms ONLY
# when price has moved at least ``brick_size_usd`` from the previous brick's
# close — the brick direction is +1 (up-brick) or -1 (down-brick), never
# both, and consecutive same-direction bricks are stacked. The resulting
# brick series collapses noise: a 1s price series that wiggles inside a
# $0.10 band produces zero bricks, while a sustained $0.50 move produces
# 5 bricks all in the same direction.
#
# Why renko is useful for FVG invalidation:
#   The current detector flips an FVG on a single 1s pierce bar — that's
#   noisy (SL-hunt false positives). Renko gives a STRUCTURAL commitment
#   signal: the market has only "decided" the zone was violated when a
#   fresh directional brick forms on the OTHER side and holds for K
#   consecutive bricks. A 1s bar wick past the zone produces no brick;
#   a real sweep that holds produces a multi-brick streak.
#
# The output ``RenkoBars`` is mapped back to the ORIGINAL 1s bar index so
# the bar loop can query "what's the renko state at 1s bar N?" with O(1)
# lookups. We also carry per-brick arrays for charting (each brick has a
# start/end 1s bar so the visualizer can draw a brick rectangle).

@dataclass
class RenkoBars:

    n_bricks : int
        Total number of bricks in the series.
    brick_open : np.ndarray (float64)
        Per-brick open price (the close of the previous brick).
    brick_close : np.ndarray (float64)
        Per-brick close price.
    brick_direction : np.ndarray (int8)
        Per-brick direction (``+1`` / ``-1``).
    brick_start_bar : np.ndarray (int32)
        1s bar index where this brick was created.
    brick_end_bar : np.ndarray (int32)
        Last 1s bar that contributed to this brick (same as start_bar
        for single-bar bricks; later if the brick "held" across several

    """Build a renko brick series from a 1s close array.

    Standard renko rules:

    * Consecutive same-direction bricks are stacked: the brick close of

    """Return the price at which a bar's range FIRST intersects an FVG zone.

    This is the canonical "mitigation touch" point — the price the chart
    annotation should plot on the zone rectangle when drawing the
    mitigation marker. The semantic: a **best-estimate of the actual
    fill price**, NOT the bar's deepest penetration.

    Two cases:

    * ``bar_close`` inside the zone (the standard mitigation semantic):
      the touch price is interpolated between the **zone's entry-side
      edge** (``zone_high`` for a bull FVG dip — price came from above;
      ``zone_low`` for a bear FVG spike — price came from below) and
      the bar's close at ``position_in_bar``. The entry-side edge is
      the FIRST tick that crossed into the zone; the close is the
      FINAL tick before the bar settled. The fill happened somewhere
      between these two prices.
    * bar's range straddles the zone but close is outside (a wick-only
      touch OR an overshoot): the touch price is interpolated between
      the **zone's entry-side edge** and the bar's close (which is
      outside the zone on the entry side — i.e. the bar pulled back
      out before settling).

    ``position_in_bar`` lets the user tune the fill-price assumption:

    * ``position_in_bar=0.0`` → returns the zone's entry-side edge
      (the FIRST tick that crossed into the zone — the canonical
      "mitigation touch" price for a bar whose sub-bar time series
      we don't have).
    * ``position_in_bar=0.5`` → midpoint between zone edge and bar
      close. A neutral default for the fill price.
    * ``position_in_bar=1.0`` → returns the bar's close (the FINAL
      tick before the bar settled).

    For close-inside-zone fills, the marker always sits INSIDE the
    zone rectangle by construction (interpolation between two
    zone-edge prices yields an in-zone result). For wick-only
    touches, the marker may sit outside the zone on the entry side —
    use a thin dashed connecting line to keep the visual link to the
    rectangle.

    Returns ``None`` when the bar's range misses the zone entirely.

    Added 2026-08-20 so the viz can plot mitigation markers at a
    best-estimate of the actual mitigation price instead of plotting
    ``bar_close`` at a price that's often well outside the gap (because
    the close that "filled" the gap is from the bar AFTER the gap was
    opened, and the bar can continue moving past the gap before
    settling). Updated 2026-08-20 to interpolate between the ZONE
    EDGE and the bar close (not the bar's range extremes), so the
    marker always sits inside the zone rectangle for close-inside
    fills — the previous version interpolated between bar_low/bar_high
    which produced markers OUTSIDE the zone when the bar's range
    extended far past the zone edges (the common case for a 1s bar).

    A bull FVG forms at bar ``i`` when ``high[i-2] < low[i]`` — candle 1's
    high is below candle 3's low. The zone is ``[c1.H, c3.L]``. Per ICT
    (2026-08-19 user clarification), "c1 and c3's colors are irrelevant"
    — the bull/bear designation comes purely from the gap position, NOT
    from the middle candle's direction. (Earlier iterations required the
    middle candle to be bullish/bearish; that constraint was removed because
    it filtered out valid FVGs where the displacement candle happened to
    be a doji or wick-dominated bar.)

    A bear FVG is the mirror: ``high[i] < low[i-2]``, zone = ``[c3.H, c1.L]``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    open_, high, low, close : np.ndarray
        Raw OHLC arrays (any frequency — typically 1s).
    warmup : int
        Skip this many bars at the start of the array.
    max_active_zones : int
        **Cache cap (added 2026-08-18).** Maximum number of zones to
        keep alive simultaneously. When the live zone count exceeds
        this number, the OLDEST zones are dropped (LRU eviction by
        ``trigger_bar``). This bounds the mitigation-scan complexity
        at O(N × max_active_zones) instead of O(N × total_zones).
        Set to ``0`` (default) for unlimited (legacy behaviour).
        On 1s data this can drop 99%+ of stale zones; the live
        ``fvg_max_cache_size`` field on ``TrendStrategyParams``
        forwards to this argument.
    resample_to_n_secs : int
        **2026-08-18: FVG timeframe knob.** If > 0, internally
        aggregates OHLC into N-second bars BEFORE scanning for FVGs.
        This lets you detect "1-minute FVGs" (``resample_to_n_secs=60``)
        or "5-minute FVGs" (``resample_to_n_secs=300``) on a 1s
        data feed without pre-aggregating to a different
        parquet. The retest logic in ``fvg_retest_signals`` still
        operates on the original 1s bars — only the *zone
        detection* is at the higher timeframe. Useful because
        a 1m FVG is structurally different from a 1s FVG:
        the 1s FVG is often noise (a 5-cent gap that closes
        within 2 seconds) while a 1m FVG is a real displacement.
        ``0`` (default) keeps the legacy 1s behaviour.
    fvg_min_zone_usd : float
        **2026-08-18: minimum zone size.** Skip FVGs whose zone
        width (``zone_high - zone_low``) is below this threshold.
        Default ``0.0`` = no filter. Useful for cleaning up
        1s-bar noise FVGs that have width < ``TICK_VALUE_USD``
        = $0.01. Pass ``0.05`` (= 5 cents) for a "real" FVG
        filter.
    max_zone_age_bars : int
        **2026-08-18: zone lifetime cap.** Mark a zone as
        ``expired_bar`` (= ``trigger_bar + max_zone_age_bars``)
        once it has been alive longer than this many bars
        without being retested. ``0`` (default) = unlimited
        lifetime (legacy). For 1m FVG a sensible default is
        ``180`` (= 3 hours) — most 1m FVGs are retested within
        30 min; capping at 3h keeps the live zone list bounded.
Expired zones are NOT drawn by the visualizer and the
        retest scanner skips them (``live=False``).
    fvg_displacement_ratio : float
        **2026-08-19: displacement quality filter.** Require the
        middle candle's size to be at least this many times the
        LARGER of c1.size and c3.size. ``0.0`` (default) disables.
        ``2.0`` is the typical ICT "real displacement" threshold
        (c2 must be ≥2× the larger of c1/c3).
    fvg_body_definition : str
        **2026-08-19: how to measure candle size.**
        ``"body"`` (default) = abs(close - open); ``"range"``
        = high - low.
    fvg_min_zone_atr_mult : float
        **2026-08-20: ATR-relative zone-width filter.** If > 0,
        drop zones whose width (``zone_high - zone_low``) is below
        ``fvg_min_zone_atr_mult * atr_for_min_zone``. The
        motivation is that ``fvg_min_zone_usd`` is regime-blind —
        a $0.30 zone is thin during a 2-USD ATR session but
        noise during a 20-cent ATR session. The ATR multiplier
        makes the threshold adaptive. ``0.0`` (default) keeps
        the legacy absolute filter (``fvg_min_zone_usd``) only.
    atr_for_min_zone : float
        **2026-08-20: ATR scalar used by the ATR-relative filter.**
        Pass the recent regime ATR (e.g. ``compute_simple_atr(...)``
        at the dataset midpoint). Ignored when
        ``fvg_min_zone_atr_mult == 0``.
    supersede_on_new : bool
        **2026-08-20: supersede older zones when a new FVG overlaps.**
        When ``True`` (default at the strategy level), any live zone
        whose ``[zone_low, zone_high]`` is overlapped (by any amount)
        by a newly-formed zone's ``[zone_low, zone_high]`` is marked
        ``superseded_bar`` (and ``live=False``). Superseded zones do
        NOT fire retest entries — only the newest zone in a price
        region is structurally interesting. ``False`` (default at
        the detector level to keep the function deterministic) keeps
        the legacy "every live zone can fire" semantic. The
        ``fvg_supersede_on_new`` field on ``TrendStrategyParams``
        forwards to this argument.
    invalidation_min_pierce_usd : float
        **2026-08-20: minimum close-past-edge for pierce.** Require the
        close to extend BEYOND the zone edge by at least N USD before
        the bar counts as a pierce. A wick past the zone (where the
        close stays inside) is NOT a pierce. ``0.0`` (default) = any
        close on the wrong side counts. For 1s XAUUSD a sensible value
        is ``0.05``–``0.10``. See ``fvg_invalidation_min_pierce_usd``
        on ``TrendStrategyParams``.
    invalidation_min_consecutive_bars : int
        **2026-08-20: sustained pierce before inversion.** Require K
        consecutive closes on the wrong side before declaring the zone
        inverted. ``1`` (default) = legacy single-tick behaviour.
        ``3``–``5`` is a sensible 1s XAUUSD setting (kills SL-hunt
        false positives where one tick past the zone gets followed by
        a tick back inside). See
        ``fvg_invalidation_min_consecutive_bars`` on
        ``TrendStrategyParams``.
    require_retest_to_invert : bool
        **2026-08-20: distinguish pierce from iFVG.** When ``True``
        (recommended default at the strategy level), the zone's
        ``inverted_bar`` is NOT set on the pierce bar — it's set on
        the bar where price RETURNS to retest the zone from the OTHER
        side. Concretely: a bull FVG with a pierce at bar J is only
        confirmed inverted at the first bar ≥ J+1 whose close is back
        on the ORIGINAL side of the zone (``c > zone_high``). The
        pierce is recorded on ``FvgZone.pierced_bar`` either way.

        Why this matters: SL hunts on 1s XAUUSD often probe the zone
        edge by many ticks but never retest — the move is one-way
        through the zone. The previous detector (single-tick pierce
        = inversion) flipped polarity on these probes and forced a
        soft-stop on every open position sourced from the zone,
        right at the worst price in the move. With retest
        confirmation the probe is recorded but the inversion only
        fires when the market actually comes back to retest the
        invalidated zone — the iFVG semantic the textbook describes.

        ``False`` (default at the detector level, deterministic for
        callers that don't opt in) keeps the legacy single-tick
        pierce semantic. The ``fvg_require_retest_to_invert`` field
        on ``TrendStrategyParams`` (default ``True``) forwards to
        this argument.
    played_out_min_extension_usd : float
        **2026-08-20: played-out mark.** The minimum USD the close
        must extend BEYOND the zone edge in the FAVORABLE direction
        before the zone is marked played out (and dead forever).
        ``0.0`` (default) disables the played-out semantic.

    fvg_min_lifetime_secs : int
        **2026-09-17: minimum FVG lifetime filter.** Drop any zone
        whose first end event (mitigated / inverted / superseded /
        played-out / structure-invalidated) occurs within
        ``fvg_min_lifetime_secs`` detector bars of the zone's
        ``trigger_bar``. On 1s data this is a wall-clock second;
        the filter is purely bar-count. Default ``0`` = disabled.

    The output is a list of ``FvgZone`` objects with mitigation and
    inversion tracked forward through the rest of the data.
    ``max_active_zones`` bounds the live-zone bookkeeping so memory
    stays O(1) on long windows.

    """Walk every FVG zone and emit retest-entry signals.

    A "retest" is the first bar AFTER the mitigation bar (or after the
    inversion bar, for iFVG entries) where the bar's range crosses the
    zone. This is the canonical ICT retest semantic — the entry fires
    when price RETURNS to the zone after first filling it, NOT on the
    mitigation bar itself.

    Without this offset the scanner would fire on the same bar as the
    mitigation, which is structurally the same as entering on the FVG
    bar (no actual retest happens — the first touch IS the mitigation).

    Mitigation = first touch (price filling the gap).
    Retest     = second touch (price returning to the zone after the
                 initial fill) — this is the entry.

    For un-mitigated zones (a fresh FVG with no fill yet) the scan
    falls back to ``trigger_bar + 1`` so live FVGs that have never been
    touched still get entries when price first arrives.

    Entry direction:
      - long on bull FVG retest, short on bear FVG retest
      - for inverted FVGs the direction flips (entering long on a
        violated-bear-FVG, now bull iFVG, is the canonical ICT reversal).

    Returns a list of ``(bar_index, direction, zone)`` tuples.

    Mitigation-depth filter (added 2026-08-20):
        ``min_mitigation_pct`` is the minimum fraction of the zone's
        height that must have been covered by a bar's range before
        the retest signal can fire. ``0.0`` (default) accepts any
        touch (legacy). ``0.5`` requires a bar whose range covered
        at least 50% of the zone's height. ``1.0`` requires a full
        fill (bar range fully covered the zone). The motivation:
        a wick-only touch (≈0% depth) is not a real mitigation —
        price wicked into the zone but the close stayed outside.
        The first-touch entry fallback for un-mitigated zones
        (when ``z.mitigated_bar < 0``) is now also gated on depth:
        if no bar has reached ``min_mitigation_pct``, the fallback
        does NOT fire either.

    By default the source is read from ``p.signal_source``. To emit
    signals from MORE THAN ONE source (the multi-source compositing
    feature added 2026-08-18), call this function once per source
    and concatenate the lists. The TrendStrategyParams will hold the
    ``additional_sources`` list and the backtest driver iterates.

    Each source:
      * ``"fvg"``     — first-bar entries on FVG displacements.
                        Gated on GMMA bias by default (long in bull,
                        short in bear).
      * ``"ifvg"``    — entries on the FIRST retest of an INVERTED FVG
                        zone. Gating is inverted: long on bull-inverted-
                        FVG, short on bear-inverted-FVG. Bias gate is
                        typically disabled (``gate_on_gmma_bias=False``)
                        because the inversion IS the reversal signal.
      * ``"orb"``     — breakouts of the London/NY opening range.
      * ``"wyckoff"`` — only spring/UTAD bars (rare).

    **Retest lookback** (added 2026-08-18): when
    ``p.fvg_retest_lookback > 0``, the function only emits signals
    for FVG/iFVG zones whose ``trigger_bar`` (FVG) or
    ``inverted_bar`` (iFVG) is within the last
    ``fvg_retest_lookback`` bars of the signal bar. This caps the
    lookback so we don't pile up ancient zones.

    **Breadth-scaled SL/TP** (added 2026-08-18): when
    ``p.fvg_sl_per_breadth > 0`` or ``p.fvg_tp_per_breadth > 0``,
    the per-signal ``stop_usd`` / ``target_usd`` are computed as
    ``k * zone_width`` instead of the global ``strat.sl_usd`` /
    ``strat.tp_usd``. The zone width = ``zone_high - zone_low``.
    This makes wide FVGs ride further and narrow FVGs cut tighter.

    All signals carry the canonic ``PendingSignal`` fields:
    ``trigger_bar``, ``direction``, ``triggered_by`` (set to the
    source name), ``stop_usd``, ``target_usd``.
